## Project Overview
This project aims to uncover insights into diabetes by analyzing various health metrics, with a focus on pregnancy-related factors and the diabetes pedigree function. The insights derived from this analysis inform the creation of a Power BI dashboard that aids healthcare professionals and analysts in understanding the data's implications.

## Datasets
- `diabetes.csv`: The original dataset containing health metrics related to individuals.
- `diabetes_transformed.csv`: The transformed dataset after cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

## Data Analysis and EDA
The `Healthcare Analytics Diabetes EDA.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains the exploratory data analysis. The following steps were performed:
1. Data Exploration: An initial assessment of data to understand its structure.
2. Data Cleaning: [Description of the data cleaning and preprocessing steps]
3. Data Visualization: Visual insights into the dataset's distribution and key metrics.
4. Correlation Analysis: Examination of potential relationships between different variables.
5. Conclusion: Summary of the findings and their implications for diabetes onset related to pregnancy.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard `Healthcare Analytics Diabetes and Pregnancy Insights Dashboard.pbix` offers a visual representation of the data analysis. It includes interactive elements to filter and drill down into specific metrics for deeper analysis.
